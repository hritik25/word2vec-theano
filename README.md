# word2vec-theano
DESCRIPTION : 
A simple ( unoptimized ) implementation of word2vec in python using Theano. This is a direct implementation of the paper 'word2vec Parameter Learning Explained' by Xin Rong.

MOTIVATION :
I had to understand the implementation details of Google's word2vec algrithm as first introduced in "Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality" by Mikolov et al. 2013.

APPLICATIONS :
I have trained my model on the The Harry Potter Series and can be run through the API.
